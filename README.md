# SpiritSite2
The code I used to create the Spirit Blog site!

**This is not the code that will be deployed. Just showing my work here before I deviate from this public repo to avoid security issues.**

This was made using React, Node.js, and mySQL. 

Website Design inspired by https://www.perraultarchitecture.com/en/
